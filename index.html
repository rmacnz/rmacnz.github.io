						<h2 class='section-header'>Work Experience:</h2>
						<p>I have done three co-ops.</p>
						<h3>PowerAdvocate:</h3>
						<p>My latest co-op was at PowerAdvocate, an energy intelligence company in Boston, MA. I worked as a web developer for them for about 7 months. During my time here I was really trying to decide what type of work would be best for me after I graduate. I learned that what matters most to me is the people I am working with. At PowerAdvocate I worked with an excellent team that made me feel like part of their family. </p>
						<h3>University of Maryland:</h3>
						<p>In 2014 I spent 6 months doing research at the University of Maryland. I was trying to discover if I wanted to pursue a PhD. I have always loved school and never wanted to stop learning, so I thought this might be the right path for me. In the end I decided I would rather work in industry, but I am glad I had this experience to show me that.</p>
						<h3>Vernale:</h3>
						<p>My first co-op was at Verndale, a web development company in Boston, MA. I worked as a Junior Engineer for them for about 8 months (2 in the summer and then 6 for a co-op the following spring). This was my first step into the web development world and I loved it. I was particularly involved in the back-end coding.</p>
